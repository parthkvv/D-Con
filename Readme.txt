Each user holds an account on the forum. To begin with, users can log in to original account or create a new one. On the profile section, they can make changes about their profile, like adding contact information, updating profile picture, adding educational and background info(explore to find out more!). Having done with the profile setup, they can reach out to other users for their doubts by typing them out on a textbox. Tagging options are enabled for adding tags for the relevant topics while asking questions. Functionality for sending connection request enabled between users. Chatbox menu available for users to interact with their peers already connected with. Users can add comments, share on social media, like and suggest edits(based on a preliminary ranking algorithm that ranks users based on monthly activity) to other user's posts.
